# Learning Genetic Algorithms
A project to learn genetic algorithms by solving the 8-queens problem. This problem involves placing 8 queens on a chessboard such that no queen can attack one another. It is very computationally heavy to solve with brute-force, thus other solutions such as genetic algorithms are used.


## Installation
This project contains the entire solution for visual studio. If visual studio is installed, then load up the solution and compile the project.

## Usage
Once the .exe loads, press 0 then enter to start the algorithm. Then for benchmarking purposes, input the number of times the algorithm should run. The program will run the algorithms and display each time the fitness for a solution is closer to being solved. At the very end of the program, the total run time as well as the average number of generations to solve the problem will be displayed. 

## Learning Outcome
To gain understanding of the usage of genetic algorithms, some of their applications, and the creation of fitness functions with constraints.
